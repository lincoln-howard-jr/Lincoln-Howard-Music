    This musically smart album is built around Lincoln’s expansive vocals. The album shares the reflections of disconsolate teenagers (Never Said), the whimsical musings on flirtations that never happened (Don’t Say), and meditations on the illusion of being okay (Broken Utopia). There is also a warm and beautiful rendition of You Are Mine, which stands apart from the other tracks that come in different shades of blue. You Are Mine might seem out of place on this otherwise melancholy album, but nevertheless, it is a fitting end to the three-song sequence that begins with Say Goodbye. Lincoln’s rendition of this popular Christian hymn is warm and beautiful.

    Here is how Lincoln describes his goal when writing a song, “A lot of people write or interpret music as a story, but I prefer to devote a song to a single emotion and try to make people feel what I feel.” The confessional lyrics of Broken Utopia, Now and Then, Guardian Angel, and Capture Me are autobiographical, yet evoke emotions that all can relate to.

    The performances of Say Goodbye, You Are Mine, and Never Said on this album are solely vocals and piano. The remaining songs feature Nate Ramey (drums), Will Crosswait (bass), Jack Hubbell (guitar), and Jason Tyler (guitar on Now and Then); their performances add greatly to the overall effect.
